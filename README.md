Discover two innovative recommender models designed to guide students in selecting new courses from a vast learning provider database. These models leverage user ratings and course descriptions to tailor recommendations to individual preferences. One approach focuses on creating user profiles and suggesting similar courses based on content, while the other utilizes clustering techniques to match students with similar interests. While currently lacking "cold" recommendations, future iterations of this project will integrate collaborative filtering and predictive modelling techniques, along with incorporating advanced NLP methods. Stay tuned for exciting updates as I continue to enhance this project!
