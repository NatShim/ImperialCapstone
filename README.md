# COURSE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
Discover two innovative recommender models designed to guide students in selecting new courses from a vast learning provider database. These models leverage user ratings and course descriptions to tailor recommendations to individual preferences. One approach focuses on creating user profiles and suggesting similar courses based on content, while the other utilizes clustering techniques to match students with similar interests. While currently lacking "cold" recommendations, future iterations of this project will integrate collaborative filtering and predictive modelling techniques, along with incorporating advanced NLP methods. Stay tuned for exciting updates as I continue to enhance this project!

## DATA
Database from IBM repository is used, it includes available course descriptions and user ratings
•	First dataset – courses description with keywords/genres:
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-ML321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/course_genre.csv
•	Second dataset – course rating:
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-ML321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/ratings.csv
•	Third dataset – courses description:
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-ML321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/course_processed.csv

## MODEL 
I'm using user profile based model utilising content similarity and clustering based model (k-mean method with PCA), making recommendations to match students with similar interests. This is an explorative project, so I'm trying different models and compare their performance. In future I'm planning to add more models and probably to build a hybrid one. 

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
K-mean clustering with PCA has n-clusters (number of clusters) and n-compoments (number of principal components for PCA) hyperparameters. For optimisation of both the grid method is used. The optimised number of clusters is chosen using elbow method, the number of components - 90% threshold for accumulated variance ratio. For all models we keep 10 best recommendations per user.

## RESULTS
The comparison between recommendations generated by both models indicates a similarity level of under 10%. While one might suggest that clustering-based analysis may outperform content-based approaches, it's important to note that without live deployment and accumulated feedback, this remains speculative. Exploring additional models, conducting further comparisons, and potentially incorporating a hybrid approach could yield valuable insights and enhance the accuracy of recommendations.
